/*
    Tear-offs
        - when we refer to a function, method or named constructor without parentheses, Dart create Tear-offs.
          when we call a function, we use parentheses (), like myFunction(). But when we refer to it, we mention the
          function's name without calling it. For example, myFunction without the parentheses.
        - A tear-off in Dart is like saving a function or method for later use without calling it right away.
        - When we refer to a function (without the parentheses), Dart creates something called a "tear-off."
